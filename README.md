Well... The title is pretty explicit, it's just a simple personal website written in pure HTML, CSS and JavaScript. As you could have already guessed, simply clone this repository and double-click index.html to visit the site. Or even better, just go to https://zariy-zariy.github.io/

**Everything is open source ! Yay !**
